## 👋 Hello, I'm Raj Motwani!

📊 I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights using tools like R, Python, Power BI, and SQL Server Management Studio. I go beyond simply working with data; I immerse myself in it to clean, analyze, and derive insights that drive strategic decision-making.

#### 📚 Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology & Analytics at Rutgers Business School, Newark, with an anticipated graduation in December 2024.

### 🧑‍💻 Professional Experience

At **Rutgers University-Newark (Graduate Assistant)**, I led the organization of orientation programs for 2,000 students, leveraging advanced Excel techniques and data pipelines to enhance our understanding of student admissions processes.

At **Indus Valley Partners (Associate Analyst and Backend Developer)**, I created data pipelines and utilized analytics tools in hedge fund operations to identify cost-saving measures that saved $40,000 and enhanced operational efficiency.

During my time at **Accenture (Associate Data Engineer)**, I focused on refining ETL processes for attrition data and improved data visualization capabilities using Power BI.

While serving as a **Data Engineering Intern at Trivia Software**, I developed a retail management system and implemented an out-of-stock alert system, which greatly improved inventory management and minimized stockouts.
